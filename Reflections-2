3 approaches to solve an array-query problem
The look up table approach where in a 2D Matrix of the size N*N is used for a linear array of size N.
The Look up table gives us the minimum value between any 2 indices of an array.
The processing speed and space complexity is O(n^2), while the fetch time is 1.
Helpful in solving most of the sub array problems 

Square root decomposition 
Array of size N is divided into sqrt(N) parts and then minimum value of each part is stored in the corresponding block in another array.
This technique is helpful only when start and end indices of a given array are in a single block i.e, difference between end and start indices is less than or equal to sqrt(N).
the time complexity is O(sqrt(N))

Segment Tree
A segment tree builds a binary tree for every adjacent elements in an array of size N and then selects the minimum value from each subtree and this goes on till root element so as to get the minimum value
The time complexity is O(NLogN) making it better than Look up table and square root decomposition
